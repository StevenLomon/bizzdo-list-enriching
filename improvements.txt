FIND THE FIRST DIV OF class="finance-persons__text-container" AND SEE IF IT HAS AN a ELEMENT. IF IT DOESN'T,
TAKE THE TEXT OF THE SPAN: https://www.hitta.se/f%C3%B6retagsinformation/mattsons+bygg+och+j%C3%A4rn+i+mora+aktiebolag/5563741544#persons
IF WE HAVE A CLICKABLE a ELEMENT, TAKE THE ENTIRE STRING. DO NOT BOTHER WITH FIRST NAME AND LAST NAME

IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE SEARCH RESULT FOR THE COMPANY, LEAVE AN URL. IT WON'T ALWAYS BE THE TOP RESULT!
https://www.hitta.se/s%C3%B6k?vad=Motorsport%20i%20Vimmerby%20AB
This brings an interesting case; even if we have the city, there can be 2+ matching results, so 100% just put the URL:
https://www.hitta.se/s%C3%B6k?vad=%C3%85kes%20Motor%20Aktiebolag
The two results can be of the same company and the verified one won't be the top result: https://www.hitta.se/s%C3%B6k?vad=Br%C3%B6derna%20H%C3%A5kanssons%20R%C3%B6r%20AB
THIS COMPANY ALSO BRINGS IMPORTANT INSIGHT: THERE WON'T ALWAYS BE A LINK TO BEFATTNINGSHAVARE!
IN THESE CASES: SEARCH FOR THE COMPANY ON PROFF? Link to a search on Proff. The reason we can't find a befattnings-
havare on Hitta.se could be that the company is liquidated
IN SOME CASES, THE HITTA.SE PERSONAL PAGE WILL HAVE A PERSONAL NUMBER. IN THESE CASES: PUT THE URL
IN A COLUMN WITH PERSONAL NUMBERS? LOOK FOR THE PAGE SELECTOR AND DON'T CRASH THE PROGRAM IF IT ISN'T THERE

THERE CAN BE CASES WHERE WE ACCESS THE SITE BUT IT WILL BE EMPTY??????????????
https://www.hitta.se/f%C3%B6retagsinformation/finncont+ab/5592042807#persons
The same company gives several results on Proff.se where the one we want just happens to be the top result. 
IF TEXT == "1 resultat", PROCEED, OTHERWIRSE GIVE THE SEARCH URL
THE SAME COMPANY ALSO SHOWS "Likvidation" on Proff. wtf
An example where the tilltalsnamn is not the middle one: https://www.hitta.se/f%C3%B6retagsinformation/f%C3%A4rgelanda+bygghandel+ab/5569218968#persons
Sometimes the VD:s personal number can be on the company page? https://www.hitta.se/sun+off+lule%C3%A5/gammelstad/jgvhiobzd
Same but without the names?? https://www.hitta.se/allv%C3%A4rmeteknik+kvv+ab/valdemarsvik/kmsdhcos
The company search can give 69 results, none of them being the one we want: https://www.hitta.se/s%C3%B6k?vad=Tidab%20AB
